#Rainy Day Science


This project was created in 24 hours at the San Francisco Science Hack, 2016. The purpose was to provide a way for kids and their parents to find homemade science experiments they could perform from household items.

###User Experience
Users can enter items they found around their house into their materials queue, or select the ones they have from a pre-set list. As items are entered into the queue, a list of possible experiments that can be completed with those items is shown.

When viewing a specific experiment, users can see a description, materials required, embedded demonstration video, the experiment procedure and an explanation on how the project works.

###Tech Used
This de-coupled app uses a rails backend (found [here](https://github.com/jchoo157/RainyDayScience) ) and a React front-end.
